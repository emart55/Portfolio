My contact form in my contact.html sends an email to me when completed. My projects page has place fillers for now, and will be updating these as the course goes on. }}-

### Bonus (optional)
{{ I have mainly employed hover states within my website and one focus state. My hovers are used for my navigation buttons to increase padding, colour changes, outlines etc. For my focus state, it is applied when an 'input'element recieves focus, changing the border colour and adding box shadow. I was going to employ Javascript but didn't get a chance in the end. }}-
