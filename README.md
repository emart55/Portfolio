### Bonus (optional)
{{ I have mainly employed hover states within my website and one focus state. My hovers are used for my navigation buttons to increase padding, colour changes, outlines etc. For my focus state, it is applied when an 'input'element recieves focus, changing the border colour and adding box shadow. I was going to employ Javascript but didn't get a chance in the end. }}-
